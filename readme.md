Jam-A-Lot is a social media web-app that easily connects musicians in a given area. Created using Laravel 4.2, Jam-A-Lot showcases a number of social-media features such as following users, writing statuses and comments, creating and attending events, as well as handling notifications. By implementing key programming features such as using polymorphic model relationships, structuring using command handlers and repositories, sending AJAX requests, and other important object-oriented principles, Jam-A-Lot is a solid representation of the skills we have learned here at Codeup.
